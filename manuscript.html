<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
In times of crisis such as the Corona pandemic citizens need to stay
informed about recent events, the latest political decisions, or
mandatory protection measures. To this end, many people use various
types of media, and increasingly social media. However, because social
media are particularly engaging, some find it hard to disconnect and
cannot stop ‘doomscrolling’. In this preregistered study, I investigate
whether using social media for COVID-19 related reasons affects
psychological well-being. To answer this question I analyzed data from
the Austrian Corona Panel Project, which consists of 24 waves with
overall 3,018 participants. I ran three random effects within between
models, controlling for several stable and varying confounders. Results
showed that the effects of COVID-19 related social media use on
well-being were very small, arguably too small to matter. The findings
suggest that fears that social media use during times of crisis impairs
well-being are likely to be unfounded.
</div>

</div>


<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic it was critical to stay informed
regarding the latest developments. How dangerous is the virus? In what
region is it spreading? How is it transmitted? What are the current
safety regulations? To obtain relevant information, many people heavily
relied on social media, which were at an all time high <span
class="citation">(Statista, 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Some actually could not stop using social media to learn about
COVID-19 related news. A new phenomenon termed “doomscrolling” emerged.
Many users were glued to their screens and found it hard to pursue other
relevant activities such as working, taking a break, or even looking
after their children <span class="citation">(Klein, 2021)</span>. In the
media it was hence increasingly asked whether using social media for
COVID-19 related reasons would, next to all other stressors, create an
additional burden on mental health <span class="citation">(Sandstrom et
al., 2021)</span>. Although research has begun addressing this question
<span class="citation">(Bendau et al., 2021; Bradley &amp; Howard, 2021;
Choi &amp; Choung, 2021; Dörnemann et al., 2021; Eden et al., 2020;
Guazzini et al., 2022; Latikka et al., 2022; Liu &amp; Tong, 2020; Riehm
et al., 2020; Sewall et al., 2021; Stainback et al., 2020; Yue et al.,
2022)</span>, it still largely unknown if COVID-19 related social media
use during the pandemic has had a meaningful impact on well-being. By
analyzing large-scale panel data from Austria and by focusing on
intra-individual causal effects, this study aims to answer to this
question.</p>
<div id="understanding-well-being-and-media-use" class="section level2">
<h2>Understanding Well-being and Media Use</h2>
<!-- Two underlying theories guided the selection of variables for this study, namely the two-continua model of mental health [@greenspoonIntegrationSubjectiveWellbeing2001] and the hierarchical taxonomy of computer-mediated communication [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- According to the two-continua model, mental health consists of (a) psychopathology and (b) well-being. -->
<!-- <!-- Because the aim of this study is better to understand typical users and everyday contexts, my focus will be on well-being. -->
<!-- Well-being can be differentiated into subjective and psychological well-being [@dienerAdvancesOpenQuestions2018]. -->
<!-- Whereas subjective well-being emphasizes hedonic aspects such as happiness and joy, psychological well-being addresses eudaimonic aspects such as fulfillment and meaning. -->
<!-- Subjective well-being is primarily about achieving positive and avoiding negative affect. -->
<!-- One of the most prominent indicators of well-being is life satisfaction. -->
<!-- In my view, because it represents a general appraisal of one's life, life satisfaction is best thought of as a meta concept combining psychological and subjective well-being. -->
<!-- Notably, life satisfaction is stable and fluctuates only little, whereas it's the exact opposite for affect [@dienlinImpactDigitalTechnology2020]. -->
<!-- <!-- Everyone can feel bad on any given day, but whether or not one feels generally comfortable in one's life rather changes across years. -->
<!-- To capture well-being in this study I thus build on life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. -->
<!-- Together, this should provide an encompassing perspective on potential media effects. -->
<!-- The hierarchical taxonomy of computer-mediated communication differentiates six levels of how people engage with digital technology. -->
<!-- First, the device (e.g., smartphone); second, the type of application (e.g., social networking site); third, the branded application (e.g., Twitter); fourth, the feature (e.g., status post); fifth, the interaction (e.g., one-to-many); and sixth, the message (e.g., content) [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- Whereas the first four levels focus on the communication _channel_, the last two address the communication _type_. -->
<!-- Distinguishing different communication channels and communication types is important, because the effects on well-being likely differ across communication channels and communication types. -->
<!-- Whereas active social media use such as chatting is routinely linked to improved well-being, passive use such as reading is often considered more negative [@dienlinImpactDigitalTechnology2020]. -->
<!-- Similarly, branded apps are separate communication entities with potentially divergent effects and affordances. -->
<!-- For example, @waterlooNormsOnlineExpressions2018 found that it's more adequate to express negative emotions on WhatsApp than on Twitter or on Instagram. -->
<!-- Especially during a pandemic, it makes sense to analyze if users engage with COVID-19 related content on Instagram, where communication is more positive, or on Facebook, where communication is more critical. -->
<!-- First studies suggest that during the pandemic Instagram use was indeed more beneficial for well-being than Facebook use [@masciantonioDonPutAll2021]. -->
<!-- In this study, to measure the effects of social media use focused on COVID-19 related news and topics, I adopt both the channel and the type of communication perspective. -->
<!-- Together, this should offer a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of communication. -->
<p>This study investigates how different <em>facets</em> of well-being
are affected by different <em>types</em> and different <em>channels</em>
of communication <span class="citation">(Meier &amp; Reinecke,
2020)</span>.
<!-- , namely active and passive use [@ellisonWhyWeDon2020; @meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- Defining what constitutes active and what passive use is not always clear, and different understandings are currently discussed [@ellisonWhyWeDon2020; @meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- Reading is generally considered as passive and writing as active use, while there are also specific behaviors falling somewhere in-between such as liking or sharing content [@meierDoesPassiveSocial2022]. -->
<!-- In this study,  --> Building on the typology of subjective
well-being <span class="citation">(Diener et al., 2018)</span>, three
different well-being facets are analyzed: life satisfaction, positive
affect, and negative affect. Because effects of social media depend on
how they are used <span class="citation">(Verduyn et al., 2015)</span>,
I further distinguish three types of use and five popular channels. The
types of use include reading, posting, and liking and sharing COVID-19
related posts. In doing so, this study analyzes social media use focused
on COVID-19 related content, which includes posting thoughts about the
pandemic, reading posts and comments, or retweeting COVID-19 related
news. The five channels to be investigated are Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube, which at the time ranked among the
most popular social media services in Austria.</p>
<!-- ## Theorizing Social Media Effects on Well-Being -->
<!-- <!-- In conclusion, most effects are likely somewhere between trivial and small. -->
<!-- <!-- I therefore expect that also in the case of COVID-19 related social media use effects will be trivial to small. -->
<p>How could the various types and channels of COVID-19 related social
media use affect well-being?
<!-- In what follows, I outline potential arguments as to why the effect might be positive or negative, direct or indirect, or nonexistent. -->
According to the set-point theory, well-being is surprisingly stable
<span class="citation">(Lykken, 1999)</span>. Although specific events
such as marriage or salary can have significant impacts on well-being,
in most cases effects are only short-term, with well-being after some
time routinely returning to prior levels <span class="citation">(Sheldon
&amp; Lucas, 2014)</span>. Only very specific factors such as
unemployment, disability, or death can cause long-term changes in
well-being <span class="citation">(Lucas, 2007)</span>.
<!-- So although well-being can change this does not happen easily. -->
<!-- Although the set-point theory has been criticized lately because events such as marriage, unemployment, or death can indeed lead to long-term changes, it is still widely maintained that well-being is very stable and hence hard to be influenced  -->
Can media use be such a factor? Current literature overviews suggest no:
Although social media use on average decreases well-being, the effects
are small <span class="citation">(Meier &amp; Reinecke, 2020)</span>. In
addition, the effects of media use differ across individuals and types
of content <span class="citation">(Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2013)</span>.
Whereas for some users social media are more beneficial, for others they
are more harmful. For example, in one study it was estimated that
roughly one quarter of all users experienced negative effects, another
quarter positive effects, while for the rest the effects were neutral
<span class="citation">(Beyens et al., 2021)</span>. This finding is
aligned with the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model:
<!-- This finding is aligned with the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model:  -->
Although there is substantial <em>variation</em> of media effects for
individual users, there are both negative and positive aspects, leading
to small effects on average <span class="citation">(Valkenburg &amp;
Peter, 2013)</span>—as confirmed by several literature overviews <span
class="citation">(Dienlin &amp; Johannes, 2020; Huang, 2017; Meier &amp;
Reinecke, 2020; Orben, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Why are the effects of social media use on well-being small on
average? Using Social media is ambivalent. It can impair well-being when
causing embarrassment, stress, or disinformation, and it can improve
well-being when providing connectedness, information, or entertainment
<span class="citation">(Büchi, 2021)</span>. Although social media are
often associated with negative outcomes, there are a large number of
positive effects, which either offset or at least significantly reduce
negative outcomes. Positive outcomes encompass finding relevant
information; maintaining and fostering relationships; expressing one’s
personality; or entertaining oneself <span class="citation">(e.g.,
Pelletier et al., 2020)</span>. Negative effects include distraction;
displacement of other meaningful activities; consumption of shallow,
misleading or challenging content; or negative social comparisons <span
class="citation">(e.g., Meier &amp; Krause, 2022)</span>. People are
much more likely to use media that offer plentiful benefits <span
class="citation">(Katz et al., 1973)</span>. Users implicitly learn what
media help them regulate their mood and thereby well-being <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>. Given the ubiquitous use of
social media, the many benefits they offer, plus the general and
implicit competence to use media that foster mood management, it is
hence unlikely that the effects of social media use on well-being are
profusely negative.</p>
<!-- Two prominent media effect theories argue (mostly implicitly) against strong average negative effects. -->
<!-- According to mood management theory [@zillmannMoodManagementCommunication1988], using media can substantially affect people's moods. -->
<!-- Use can be stimulating or overwhelming, relaxing or boring. -->
<!-- After some time, users implicitly learn what media help them balance their mood and affect according to their own situational needs [@zillmannMoodManagementCommunication1988]. -->
<!-- Those media that eventually become part of one's media repertoire are hence, on average, beneficial for users to regulate their mood. -->
<!-- Using experience sampling of well-being and logs of social media use, a study with 82 participants from Italy found that after episodes of social media use, levels of positive affect increased significantly [@marcianoDynamicsAdolescentsSmartphone2022]. -->
<!-- While mood management theory considers media use mainly driven by implicit learning experiences, uses and gratifications theory upholds that the process is more explicit and rational [@katzUsesGratificationsResearch1973]. -->
<!-- Users select those media that they expect to have a desired effect, for example on mood, knowledge, or entertainment.  -->
<!-- If those beneficial media effects do not exist or if they are not expected, people will spend their time elsewhere. -->
<!-- And social media offer several beneficial effects, explaining why they are used that much. -->
<!-- They help find relevant information, maintain and foster relationships, express one's personality, and entertain oneself [@pelletierOneSizeDoesn2020]. -->
<!-- In conclusion, because people spend so much time on social media consuming COVID-19 related content, according to both mood management theory and uses and gratifications theory this is indirect proof that average effects on well-being are likely not particularly negative. -->
<!-- But people can also misjudge media effects and are often overly optimistic [@metzgerComparativeOptimismPrivacy2017]. -->
<!-- Precisely because social media have so many positive consequences, one can ask if this is not where the actual problem lies. -->
<!-- In other words, social media might not problematic because they are inherently bad, but rather because they are too good. -->
<!-- As with many other things, there can be too much of a good thing. -->
<!-- It is therefore often asked whether social media can become addictive, and users sometimes express this fear themselves [@yangCanWatchingOnline2021].  -->
<!-- However, a recently published meta-analysis found that the two most prominent measures of addiction, the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale and the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, have only small relations to well-being [@duradoniWellbeingSocialMedia2020].  -->
<!-- In addition, the general idea of labeling excessive social and new media use as addiction was criticized, arguing that social media represent new regular behaviors that should not be pathologized [@galerHowMuchToo2018; @vanrooijWeakScientificBasis2018]. -->
<!-- Because media effects can differ across users, situations, and content [@livingstoneEuropeanResearchChildren2018; @valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013], I now briefly focus on the effects of COVID-19 related social media use specifically. -->
<!-- First, one could assume a _direct_ negative effect on well-being, and especially on positive or negative affect, which are more volatile and fluctuating. -->
<!-- Dangers, inequalities, corruption---these were the headlines during the pandemic across many countries worldwide. -->
<!-- If one learns about such events, the initial reaction might be shock, fear, or dismay. -->
<!-- Consuming such news can be depressing [@dornemannHowGoodBad2021], perhaps even changing some general perspectives on life. -->
<!-- <!-- So, just like being hit by a hammer hurts and we don't need any "mediating mechanism", this could be the case here as well. -->
<!-- That said, because not all news was negative, and because many people showed solidarity and compassion, there was also positive and uplifting content, potentially compensating for the negative effects [@dornemannHowGoodBad2021]. -->
<!-- A study with 2.057 respondents from Italy reported that during the pandemic virtual community and social connectedness even increased [@guazziniSecondWaveAnalysis2022]. -->
<!-- In a study with 735 participants from Finland, levels of loneliness did not decrease during the pandemic, and people who engaged more on social media experienced less loneliness [@latikkaLonelinessPsychologicalDistress2022]. -->
<!-- However, in light of a worldwide pandemic with millions of deaths, the negative direct effect seems more plausible. -->
<!-- Second, there could also be _indirect_ effects. -->
<!-- Although it is most likely that moderate social media use is not detrimental [@orbenTeenagersScreensSocial2020], overuse, however, might be more critical, and several studies have shown more pronounced negative effects for extreme users [@przybylskiLargescaleTestGoldilocks2017]. -->
<!-- To explain, overuse could impair well-being if it replaces meaningful or functional activities such as meeting others, working, actively relaxing, or exercising. -->
<!-- Another potentially negative mechanism at play are problematic social comparison processes.  -->
<!-- Therefore, if a society collectively overuses social media during a pandemic, there is potential for negative effects. -->
<!-- If overuse replaces such activities it's reasonable to assume that it's also detrimental. -->
<!-- On the other hand, one can make the case that using social media for COVID-19 related reasons might even be beneficial, especially in times of a pandemic. -->
<!-- Exchanging COVID-19 related messages with friends via WhatsApp might replace the in-person contact one would have otherwise, but which is literally impossible at the time. -->
<!-- In situations where meaningful and functional activities are prohibited, using social media to exchange about COVID-19 related topics might not be the worst idea. -->
<!-- Besides, given that nowadays a large number of experts, scientists, and politicians converse directly on social media, one can get first-hand high quality information on current developments. -->
<!-- <!-- On the other hand, there is of course also much disinformation, and "bingeing" on COVID-19 fake news might also pose risks for impaired well-being. -->
<!-- To summarize, it seems that from a theoretical perspective it is most likely that the average effects of social media use on well-being are negligible.  -->
<!-- Building on established theories from Communication and current empirical findings, we would not assume that effects are either profoundly negative or strongly positive. -->
<!-- ## Empirical Studies on Social Media Effects -->
<p>There is still little empirical research on how well-being is
affected by social media use that is focused on COVID-19 specifically.
Results are mixed. When browsing social media for COVID-19 related news,
many users reported being captivated to such an extent they could not
stop using social media <span class="citation">(Klein, 2021)</span>.
<!-- During the pandemic social media use was at an all-time high in the US [@statistaAverageDailyTime2021], for example to cope with the required physical distancing measures. -->
In a study with 1,131 residents from Wuhan in China, people who spent
more time in quarantine also spent more time on social media <span
class="citation">(Yue et al., 2022)</span>. Those who spent more time on
social media also engaged in more upward social comparison, which was
related to increased levels of stress. People who used social media as a
primary source of information reported on average “significantly more
unspecific anxiety and depression […] and significantly more specific
COVID-19 related anxiety symptoms” <span class="citation">(Bendau et
al., 2021, p. 288)</span>. <span class="citation">Eden et al.
(2020)</span> analyzed how 425 US college students used media during the
first wave of the pandemic, finding both positive and negative relations
with well-being.
<!-- In a sample of 312 respondents collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, people who used media to attain information were more lonely and less satisfied with their lives [@choiMediatedCommunicationMatters2021]. -->
In a large-scale study with 11,537 respondents from the US, increased
COVID-19-related media consumption was related to more psychological
distress <span class="citation">(Stainback et al., 2020)</span>. A
four-wave panel study with 384 young adults from the U.S. analyzed the
effects of general digital technology use during the pandemic on mental
health, finding that digital technology did not have significant effects
on mental health <span class="citation">(Sewall et al., 2021; for a
similar study with comparable results, see Bradley &amp; Howard,
2021)</span>. A study with 2.057 respondents from Italy reported that
during the pandemic virtual community and social connectedness increased
<span class="citation">(Guazzini et al., 2022)</span>. In a study with
735 participants from Finland, levels of loneliness were stable during
the pandemic, and people who engaged more on social media experienced
less loneliness <span class="citation">(Latikka et al., 2022)</span>.
Together, the literature is mixed, showing both positive and negative
affects of social media use focused on or during COVID-19 on well-being
<span class="citation">(see also Dörnemann et al., 2021; Liu &amp; Tong,
2020; Riehm et al., 2020)</span>.
<!-- However, note that all of these findings represent between-person relations stemming from cross-sectional data (see below). -->
<!-- We therefore don't know whether the differences in mental health and well-being are due to social media use or due to other third variables, such as age, health, employment, or education. --></p>
<!-- The question of whether and how social media use affects well-being _in general_, on the other hand, is well-researched. -->
<!-- This also holds true for the different types of communication such as active or passive use. -->
<!-- What determines whether or not an effect should be considered small or trivial? -->
<!-- As a starting point, we could refer to standardized effect sizes. -->
<!-- According to @cohenPowerPrimer1992, small effect sizes start at _r_ = .10. -->
<!-- Finally, several individual studies employing advanced methods found smalls relations between social media use and well-being [@orbenSocialMediaEnduring2019; @przybylskiDoesTakingShort2021a; @schemerImpactInternetSocial2021; @kerestesAdolescentsOnlineSocial2020]. -->
<!-- Although for roughly one quarter of all users the effects of social media use on well-being were negative, for almost the same number of users they were positive, while for the rest the effects were neutral [@beyensSocialMediaUse2021]. -->
<!-- This finding is aligned with the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model:  -->
<!-- Although there is substantial _variation_ of media effects for individual users, the _average_ effects reported in the literature are often small [@valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013].  -->
<!-- Together, the strongest argument to me is that _in general_ the effects of social media on well-being are, on average, small at best.  -->
<!-- Because this study only looks at _one part_ of social media use---namely, COVID-19 related interactions---it is very focused, diminishing the overall potential of the effects even further. -->
<!-- Whether or not using social media for COVID-19 related aspects is detrimental during a pandemic is also not entirely clear. -->
<!-- At least, there does not seem to be a case where we should expect a clear deviation to the negative, despite anecdotes of doomscrolling. -->
<p>In conclusion, these mixed empirical results, together with the
observation that social media effects on well-being are very small in
general, I expect that COVID-19 related communication on social media
does not affect well-being in a meaningful or relevant way.</p>
<!-- A meta review (i.e., an analysis of meta-analyses) found that the relation between social media use and well-being is likely in the negative spectrum but very small, potentially too small to matter [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- And indeed, several if not most of the current meta-analyses find small to trivial effects [@huangTimeSpentSocial2017; @meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a; @fergusonThisMetaanalysisScreen2021]. -->
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothesis: The within-person effects of all types of COVID-19
related social media use on all types of well-being indicators—while
controlling for several stable and varying covariates such as
sociodemographic variables and psychological dispositions—will be
trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- In this study, this general hypothesis will be analyzed specifically for the three communication types of (a) time spent reading, (b) liking and sharing, and (c) actively posting COVID-19 related content. -->
<!-- In addition, I will analyze how well-being is influenced by spending time on five prominent social media apps, including (a) Facebook, (b) Instagram, (c) Twitter, (d) WhatsApp, and (e) YouTube.  -->

<h2>Preregistration</h2>
<p>The hypotheses, the sample, the measures, the analyses, and the
inference criteria (SESOI, <em>p</em>-value) were preregistered on the
Open Science Framework, accessible here: <a

class="uri">https://osf.io/87b24/?view_only=b2289b6fec214fa88ee75a18d45c18f3</a>.
Because in this study I analyze data from an already existing
large-scale data set, the preregistration was done prior to accessing
the data. The preregistration was designed on the basis of the panel
documentation online <span class="citation">(Kittel et al.,
2020)</span>. In some cases, it was impossible to execute the analyses
as I had originally planned, for example because some properties of the
variables only became apparent when seeing the actual data. The most

<div id="sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>The data come from the Austrian Corona Panel Project <span
class="citation">(Kittel et al., 2021)</span>, which is a large-scale
standalone panel study. The data are hosted on AUSSDA, are publicly
available here (<a href="https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS</a>), and consist of 32
waves. The study was conducted between March 2020 and June 2022, and
data collection is now finished. Between March 2020 and July 2020, the
intervals between waves were weekly and afterward monthly. Each wave
consists of at least 1,500 respondents. The sample size was <em>N</em> =
3,485, with overall 111,520 observations. Panel mortality was
compensated through a continuous re-acquisition of new participants.
Participants were sampled from a pre-existing online access panel
provided by the company Marketagent, Austria. Panel members were
incentivized with 180 credit points for each wave of the study.</p>
<p>Achieved via quota sampling, the sample matched the Austrian
population in terms of age, gender, region/state, municipality size, and
educational level. In order to participate in the study, the respondents
needed to be Austrian residents and had to be at least 14 years of age.
All respondents needed to have access to the internet (via computer or
mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets). Ethical review and
approval was not required for the study in accordance with the local
legislation and institutional requirements. The participants provided
their written informed consent to participate in this study. The average
age was 41 years, 49 percent were male, 14 percent had a University
degree, and 5 percent were currently unemployed.</p>

<div id="smallest-effect-size-of-interest" class="section level2">
<h2>Smallest Effect Size of Interest</h2>
<!-- ## Inference Criteria -->
<p>Testing the hypothesis necessitates defining what is considered a
“trivial effect size”. <!-- Effectively testing this hypothesis  -->
<!-- Above I already referred to standardized effect sizes. -->
<!-- However, standardized effect sizes should only be a first step toward evaluating an effect's relevance [@baguleyStandardizedSimpleEffect2009]. -->
<!-- Standardized effect sizes are determined by a sample's variance,[^cohensd] which is problematic:  -->
<!-- The question of whether or not social media use affects a particular person in a relevant way should not depend on the variance in the sample in which that person's data were collected. -->
<!-- Instead, it should depend on absolute criteria. -->
<!-- What could be a minimally interesting, nontrivial effect? --> Being
a normative question, finding a clear, single, or unanimous answer is
impossible. <!-- In the end, it is a personal question. --> However, it
is still necessary and helpful to work toward a plausible benchmark. I
suggest the following SESOI for this research question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SESOI: If a heavy user of COVID-19 related social media news suddenly
<em>stops</em> using social media altogether, this should have a
<em>noticeable</em> impact on their overall well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean practically and how can it be operationalized? In
this study, COVID-19 related social media use was measured on a 5-point
scale, ranging from 1 = <em>never</em> to 5 = <em>several times a
day</em>. Thus, a change of four units in social media use (e.g., a
complete stop) should correspond to a noticeable change in well-being.
What is a noticeable change in well-being? According to <span
class="citation">Norman et al. (2003)</span>, people can reliably
distinguish seven levels of satisfaction with health. So if satisfaction
is measured on a 7-point scale, a four unit change in social media use
should result in a one unit change in life satisfaction.
<!-- Because the data were analyzed post-hoc, no a-priori sample size planning on the basis of power analyses was conducted. -->
<!-- The sample is large, and it is hence well-equipped to reliably detect small effects. -->
<!-- <!-- , which is why no exact post hoc power analysis were conducted. -->
<!-- In addition, because such large samples easily generate significant _p_-values even for very small effects, it helps that the hypotheses were tested with a smallest effect size of interest-approach. -->
<!-- To this end, I adopted the interval testing approach as proposed by @dienesUsingBayesGet2014. -->
<!-- On the basis of the SESOI, I defined a null region. -->
<!-- In what follows, I explain how I determined the SESOI and the null region. --></p>
<p>In this study, life satisfaction was measured on an 11-point scale.
If people can reliably differentiate 7 levels, this corresponds to 11 /
7 = 1.57 unit change on an 11-point scale. Hence, a four-point change in
media use (e.g., a complete stop) should result in a 1.57-point change
in life satisfaction. In a statistical regression analysis, <em>b</em>
estimates the change in the dependent variable if the independent
variable increases by one point. For life satisfaction, we would
therefore define a SESOI of <em>b</em> = 1.57 / 4 = 0.39. For positive
or negative affect, which was measured on a 5-point scale, our SESOI
would be <em>b</em> = 0.71 / 4 = 0.18. Because we are agnostic as to
whether the effects are positive or negative, the null region includes
both negative and positive effects. Finally, in order not to exaggerate
precision and to be less conservative, these numbers are reduced to
nearby thresholds.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Together, this leads to a null region
ranging from <em>b</em> = -.30 to <em>b</em> = .30 for life
satisfaction, and <em>b</em> = -.15 to <em>b</em> = .15 for positive and
negative affect.</p>
<!-- As explained above, for well-being the null region was between _b_ = -.30 and _b_ = .30 (i.e., _b_ = |.30|). -->
<p>The hypothesis is analyzed using the interval testing approach as
proposed by <span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>. To illustrate,
if the 95% confidence interval falls completely within the null-region
(e.g., <em>b</em> = -.02, [95% CI: -.12, .08]), the hypothesis that the
effect is trivial is supported. If the confidence interval and the null
region overlap (e.g., <em>b</em> = -.22, [95% CI: -.27, -.17]), the
hypothesis is not supported and the results are considered inconclusive,
while a meaningful negative effect is rejected. If the confidence
interval falls completely outside of the null-region (e.g., <em>b</em> =
-.40, [95% CI: -.45, -.35]), the hypothesis is rejected and the
existence of a meaningful positive effect is supported. For an
illustration, see Figure @ref(fig:sesoi).</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<div id="causality" class="section level3">
<h3>Causality</h3>
<!-- The hypothesis explicitly states a causal effect. -->
<!-- In non-experimental studies, longitudinal designs can help investigate causality. -->
<p>When using longitudinal designs to analyze causality, it is important
to (a) focus on within-person effects <span class="citation">(Hamaker,
2014)</span>; to (b) control for confounders <span
class="citation">(Rohrer &amp; Murayama, 2021)</span>; and to (c) test a
plausible interval between measures <span class="citation">(Dormann
&amp; Griffin, 2015)</span>.
<!-- To illustrate, consider the following example. -->
<!-- Imagine that a person suddenly starts using social media much more than usual, and then after some time  becomes less satisfied with their life. -->
<!-- Eventually, use and life satisfaction return to prior levels. -->
<!-- If this happens to several people at the same time, in a longitudinal study we could then observe a significant effect of social media use on life satisfaction. -->
<!-- However, it could also be the case that during the study there was a major exogenous event (say, a pandemic), which caused large parts of the working population to loose their jobs. -->
<!-- Hence, the causal effect reported above was confounded, because in reality it was the pandemic that caused both social media use to rise and life satisfaction to go down. -->
<!-- Thus, only when controlling for _all_ relevant confounders, can we correctly estimate causality without bias [@rohrerThinkingClearlyCorrelations2018]. -->
<!-- Obviously, we can never be entirely sure to have included all confounders, which makes absolute statements regarding causality virtually impossible. -->
To elaborate, in non-experimental designs it makes much sense to analyze
causal effects from an internal, within-person perspective <span
class="citation">(Hamaker, 2014)</span>. If a specific person changes
their media diet, we need to measure how this behavior affects their
well-being. Between-person comparisons from longitudinal data cannot
provide such insights <span class="citation">(Lucas, 2022)</span>. To
test the hypothesis, I thus consider only the within-person effects.</p>
<p>Second, to identify confounders we should control for variables that
affect both media use and well-being, which helps isolate the actual
effect of social media use on well-being <span class="citation">(Rohrer,
2018)</span>. Because we are adopting a within-person perspective, we
need to implement <em>time-varying</em> confounders <span
class="citation">(Rohrer &amp; Murayama, 2021)</span>. And because we
are determining the <em>overall</em> causal effect, we need to make sure
<em>not</em> to control for mediating variables <span
class="citation">(Rohrer, 2018)</span>, for doing so would bias our
assessment of the causal effect.
<!-- Complicating matters further, it is often unclear if a variable is a mediator or a confounder.[^collider] -->
<!-- However, despite all these caveats, when controlling for relevant variables (that aren't mediators), we can be much more certain that we measured causality correctly. -->
<!-- The aim should therefore be to collect as many varying and non-varying confounders as possible (which I believe is seldom done in our field), while knowing that absolute certainty regarding causality cannot be reached. -->
<!-- [^collider]: In addition, there also exist colliders, which I don't discuss here and which complicate the issue even further [@rohrerThinkingClearlyCorrelations2018]. -->
<!-- We can also control for variables that affect only social media use or well-being.  -->
<!-- However, in doing so not much is gained, because the effects of social media use would remain virtually the same [@klinePrinciplesPracticeStructural2016; but see @mcelreathYesterdayClass2021]. -->
In this study, I hence preregistered to control for the following
variables, which either have already been shown or are very likely to
affect both social media use and well-being, and which also are not
mediators:
<!-- (I'll additionally include variables that likely affect only well-being, also to obtain a comparison benchmark for social media effects): -->
gender, age, education, Austria country of birth, Austria country of
birth of parents, residency Vienna, text-based news consumption,
video-based news consumption, household size, health, living space,
access to garden, access to balcony, employment, work hours per week,
being in home-office, household income, outdoor activities, satisfaction
with democracy, disposition to take risks, and locus of control.
<!-- [^explore] -->
<!-- I will not control for variables such as trust in institutions or trust in media, because these variables might be influenced by social media use to a meaningful extent. --></p>
<!-- [^explore]: The data-set includes many other variables that one could also potentially control for, and I invite interested readers to download the and explore potential interesting relationships. -->
<!-- Next to including covariates, it is now increasingly understood that  -->
<p>Finally, one precondition of causality is temporal order and finding
a plausible interval <span class="citation">(Dormann &amp; Griffin,
2015)</span>. <!-- The cause needs to precede the effect. -->
<!-- Finding the right interval between cause and effect is crucial. -->
<!-- For example, if we want to understand the effect of alcohol consumption on driving performance, it makes a big difference if driving performance is measured one minute, one hour, one day, or one week after consumption. -->
<!-- Finding the right interval is difficult. --> If variables are
stable, longer intervals are needed; if they fluctuate, shorter
intervals are required. In the case of well-being, we need shorter
intervals for the more fluctuating positive and negative affect, and
longer ones for the more stable life satisfaction <span
class="citation">(Dienlin &amp; Johannes, 2020)</span>. Using social
media can have instant effects on mood <span class="citation">(Marciano
et al., 2022)</span>. Effects on life satisfaction often take longer to
manifest, for example because media use leads to actual changes in
specific behaviors, which then in turn affect life satisfaction <span
class="citation">(Dienlin et al., 2017)</span>.
<!-- Choosing the right interval is challenging, because especially short intervals are hard to implement in practice, often requiring advanced methods such as experience sampling (also known as in situ measurement or ambulant assessment) [@schnauber-stockmannMobileDevicesTools2020]. -->
In this study, I hence analyze how using social media during the last
week affected positive and negative affect during the same week. In
other words, if people during the last week engaged in more COVID-19
related social media use than usual, did they feel better or worse
during that week than usual? For life satisfaction, I implemented a
longer interval. If people during the last week used COVID-19 related
social media more than they usually do, were they at the end of the week
more or less satisfied with their lives than they usually are? I hence
analyze if when a person changes their social media diet, are there (a)
<em>simultaneous</em> changes in their affect and (b)
<em>subsequent</em> changes in their life satisfaction? These relations
will be controlled for varying confounders, which fosters a causal
interpretation.
<!-- Similar approaches were implemented by other studies [@johannesNoEffectDifferent2022; @scharkowHowSocialNetwork2020], and they are considered a best practice approach toward analyzing causality [@bellFixedRandomEffects2019]. --></p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical model</h3>
<p>The hypothesis was analyzed using random effect within-between models
<span class="citation">(REWB, Bell et al., 2019)</span>. Altogether
three models were run, one for each dependent variable. The data were
hierarchical, and responses were separately nested in participants and
waves (i.e., participants and waves were implemented as random effects).
Nesting in participants allowed to separate between-person relations
from within-person effects. Nesting in waves allowed to control for
general exogenous developments, such as general decreases in well-being
in the population, for example due to lockdown measures. Thus, there was
no need additionally to control for specific phases or measures of the
lockdown. Predictors were modeled as fixed effects. They included social
media communication types and channels, separated into within and
between-person factors, as well as stable and varying covariates. All
predictors were included simultaneously in each of the three models.</p>
<p>The factorial validity of the scales were tested with confirmatory
factor analyses (CFA). Because Mardia’s test showed that the assumption
of multivariate normality was violated, I used the more robust
Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic (MLM) as
estimator.
<!-- To avoid over-fitting, I tested the scales on more liberal fit criteria (CFI > .90, TLI > .90, RMSEA <. .10, SRMR < .10) [@klinePrinciplesPracticeStructural2016]. -->
<!-- Finally, REWB-models cannot model latent variables. -->
<!-- To increase precision, I therefore exported factor scores from the CFAs for positive and negative affect. -->
Mean scores were used for positive and negative affect.
<!-- Respondents who answered less than 50% of all questions were removed. -->
Missing responses were imputed using multiple imputation with predictive
mean matching (five iterations, five data-sets), including categorical
variables. All variables were imputed except the social media use
measures, as they were not collected on each wave. All variables
included in the analyses presented here were used to impute missing
data.
<!-- For the main analyses, results were pooled across all five data-sets. --></p>
</div>
<div id="robustness-checks" class="section level3">
<h3>Robustness-checks</h3>
<p>To find out whether the inferences were robust across plausible but
subordinate analyses, I conducted additional exploratory analyses. I
reran the analyses (a) with additional not-preregistered covariates such
as trust in media or government, (b) without covariates, (c) with single
imputation, and (d) without imputation. For more information on the

used all 32 waves.</p>

<h3>Control variables</h3>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 related social media use were controlled for
the following stable variables: gender (female, male, diverse), age,
education (ten options), Austria country of birth (yes/no), Austria
parents’ country of birth (no parent, one parent, both parents), and
household size.
<!-- I originally planned to implement additional variables as varying covariates. -->
I also controlled for the following varying covariates: five items on
current living conditions, including self-reported physical health,
whether participants contracted COVID-19 since the last wave, current
household income, working in home-office, and overall work hours; nine
items measuring use of specific national text-based and video-based news
outlets; five items measuring outdoor activities such as exercise or
meeting friends; and three more psychological measures including locus
of control, disposition to take risks, and satisfaction with
democracy.</p>

<h2>Descriptive Analyses</h2>
<p>Looking at the variables from a descriptive perspective, aligned with
set-point theory we can see that the level of all well-being measures
were surprisingly stable during data collection (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-descriptives)). COVID-19 related social media use, however,
showed changes. Reading, sharing and liking COVID-19 related content
decreased substantially (almost one scale point from 3 to 2). Posting
about COVID-19 related content stayed the same. Using Facebook,
WhatsApp, and YouTube for COVID-19 related content decreased. Instagram
stayed the same. Twitter use slightly increased. The general initial
decrease could be explained by the fact that the collection of data
began at the end of March 2020, hence approximately three months after
the pandemic’s onset. After an initial uptick, COVID-19 related social
media use might have already been declining at the time.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Using the average values across all waves, which provides a stable
picture of the general relations, I next looked at the correlations
between social media use and well-being (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-correlations)). Several interesting patterns emerged. In
general, people who spend more time engaging with COVID-19 related
content on social media reported reduced well-being. Users who spend
more time reading, liking and sharing, and posting COVID-19 related
content were less satisfied with their lives. They also showed slightly
less positive affect. This overall negative picture was even more
pronounced for negative affect. People who engaged more with COVID-19
related content, including all types and channels of communication,
reported substantially higher levels of negative affect. For example,
people who were more likely to post COVID-19 content had much higher
levels of negative affect (<em>r</em> = .56). Note that these results
represent between-person correlations, not causal within-person
effects.</p>

<h2>Preregistered Analyses</h2>
<div id="social-media-communication-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Social media communication types</h3>
<p>The study’s main hypothesis was that the causal effects of all types
and channels of social media use on all facets of well-being would be
trivial. Regarding the effects of different communication types (i.e.,
reading, sharing, of posting about COVID-19 related content), all
within-person effects fell completely within the a-priori defined null
region (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). For example, respondents who
used social media more frequently than usual to like or share COVID-19
related content did not show a simultaneous change in life satisfaction
(<em>b</em> = -0.02 [95% CI -0.08, 0.03]). As a result, the hypothesis
of trivial effects was supported for all COVID-19 related types of
social media communication.</p>
<p>However, three effects stood out, as they were significantly
different from zero. Users who read more COVID-19 related content than
usual reported slightly reduced levels of positive affect (<em>b</em> =
-0.03 [95% CI -0.05, -0.01]). Users who liked and shared more COVID-19
related content than usual also experienced slightly more negative
affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05 [95% CI 0.02, 0.08]). Users who
wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual also experienced slightly
more negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05 [95% CI 0.02,
0.08]).</p>
</div>
<div id="social-media-communication-channels" class="section level3">
<h3>Social media communication channels</h3>
<p>Regarding the COVID-19 related use of social media channels (i.e.,
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter) the results were
comparable (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). Changes in the frequency
of using different social media channels to attain information regarding
COVID-19 were unrelated to meaningful changes in well-being. For
example, respondents who used Facebook more frequently than usual to
learn about COVID-19 did not show a simultaneous change in life
satisfaction (<em>b</em> &lt; 0.01 [95% CI -0.04, 0.04]). In sum, the
hypothesis of trivial effects was supported also for the COVID-19
related use of important social media channels.</p>
<p>That said, one effect differed substantially from zero. Respondents
who used Twitter more frequently than usual to attain COVID-19 related
news reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual
(<em>b</em> = 0.01 [95% CI &lt; 0.01, 0.03]). However, the effect was
still completely inside of the null region, hence likely not large
enough to be considered meaningful.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Analyses</h2>
<!-- In what follows, I briefly report some exploratory analyses that weren't preregistered. -->
<!-- ### Between-person relations -->
<!-- For between-person relations, no a-priori hypotheses were formulated. -->
<!-- Results showed that no relation crossed or was completely outside of the SESOI. -->
<!-- Four relations were statistically significant. -->
<!-- Respondents who across all waves used social media more frequently than others to read about COVID-19 related posts reported slightly lower levels of positive affect than others (_b_ = -0.05 [95% CI -0.08, -0.02]). -->
<!-- Respondents who across all waves used social media more frequently than others to write COVID-19 related posts reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than others (_b_ = 0.06 [95% CI 0.03, 0.10]). -->
<!-- At the same time, respondents who across all waves used social media more frequently than others to write COVID-19 related posts also reported slightly higher levels of positive affect (_b_ = 0.06 [95% CI 0.01, 0.11]). -->
<!-- Finally, respondents who across all waves used YouTube more frequently than others also reported slightly higher levels of life satisfaction than others (_b_ = 0.09 [95% CI 0.02, 0.16]). -->
<!-- However, note that the effect were still completely inside of the null region, hence not large enough to be considered practically relevant. -->
<!-- Note that when comparing the results with and without control variables, the results differed. -->
<!-- For example, on the between-person level, one effect stopped being significant if controlled for additional variables. -->
<!-- Initially, actively posting on social media was significantly (though not meaningfully) related to decreased life satisfaction. -->
<!-- However, when controlling for potential confounders, the effect became virtually zero. -->
<!-- For an overview of all between-person relations, see Figure \@ref(fig:fig-between). -->
<!-- ### Covariates -->
<p>To contextualize the results reported above and to see if the study
included any meaningful effects at all, I also looked at the effect
sizes of the covariates. Because each variable featured different
response options, which would require defining a SESOI for each
variable, I hence report the results of the standardized scales, which
allows for a better comparison across the differently scaled variables.
Here, we can build on Cohen’s convention that small effects begin at
<em>r</em> = |.10|.</p>
<p>The results showed that several effects crossed or fell completely
outside of the SESOI. They can hence be considered meaningful. For
example, if physical health decreased, this had a meaningful detrimental
impact on life satisfaction (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
= .18 [95% CI .16, .20]), positive affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .17 [95% CI .16, .18]), and
negative affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.18 [95%
CI -.19, -.17]). Spending more time outside to exercise meaningfully
increased positive affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
.12 [95% CI .11, .13]). Being more satisfied with the current democratic
system meaningfully increased life satisfaction (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .13 [95% CI .12, .14]). The
strongest aspect affecting well-being was internal locus of control. If
people felt more in control of their lives, this strongly increased both
life satisfaction (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .31 [95%
CI .28, .34]) and positive affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .27 [95% CI .25, .29]), while
decreasing negative affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
-.28 [95% CI -.30, -.26]).</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Based on a panel study with 32 waves largely representative of the
Austrian population, this study analyzed the effects of COVID-19 related
social media use on well-being. Between person correlation analyses
showed that more active users of COVID-19 related content on social
media also reported decreased well-being. The within-person relations,
which are more informative regarding causal effects, showed a different
pattern, however. If people consumed more COVID-19 content on social
media than usual, this did not meaningfully reduce their well-being.
Several statistically significant effects were found, but these were
very small. For example, people who liked and shared more COVID-19
related posts than usual reported slightly higher levels of negative
affect. Posting more content about COVID-19 than usual slightly
increased negative affect. People who read more COVID-19 related posts
than usual reported slightly decreased positive affect. Using Twitter
for COVID-19 related content slightly increased negative affect.
<!-- was related to Reading COVID-19 related content on social media slightly reduced positive affect. -->
Again, although all of these within-person effects were statistically
significant, they were very small, smaller than the predefined smallest
effect size of interest. According to the preregistered procedure, they
should hence be considered irrelevant. Other factors, for which we would
expect to find meaningful effects, such as health or sports, indeed
showed substantial and meaningful impacts on well-being. In conclusion,
COVID-19 related activity on social media was not a particularly strong
influence on peoples’ well-being. The results do not support the popular
fears that “doomscrolling” or overusing social media during times of
crises constitutes a relevant risk for well-being.</p>
<!-- People who used social media more than usual to learn about COVID-19 didn't show meaningful changes in their well-being. -->
<!-- The results imply that COVID-19 related social media use doesn't seem to be particularly relevant for well-being. -->
<!-- Other factors among the third variables that were measured revealed larger effects or relations, suggesting that well-being is rather determined by alternative aspects such as health, satisfaction with democracy, locus of control, or exercising. -->
<p>These specific observations notwithstanding, several general trends
can be observed. First, overall the results do suggest that effects of
COVID-19 related social media use on well-being tend to take place in
the negative as opposed to the positive spectrum. Although very small,
four statistically significant negative results of COVID-19 related
social media use on well-being were found. Not a single positive effect
emerged. Also note that in the analyses several control variables were
included, ruling out plausible alternative explanations for the negative
results. For example, it was controlled for whether or not participants
contracted a COVID-19 infection during a specific wave. Hence, we can
rule out the alternative explanation that having an infection was the
root cause of increased communication and reduced well-being.</p>
<p>Second, significant outcomes emerged for positive or negative affect,
but not for life satisfaction. Life satisfaction was stable and not
affected by any type or channel of social media communication. The more
fluctuating positive and negative affect, however, were affected.
Liking, sharing, and posting COVID-19 related content, and spending time
on Twitter to browse COVID-19 related content, all negatively influenced
affect. This is aligned with prior findings which showed that social
media can trigger negative affect but does not reduce life satisfaction
<span class="citation">(Huang, 2017)</span>.
<!-- Writing posts implies more substantial engagement, and perhaps also negative exchanges with other users, which could explain the results. -->
<!-- For example, people who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual reported slightly lower levels of life satisfaction than usual. -->
<!-- Similarly, people who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual also reported slightly more negative affect. -->
<!-- As a potential explanation, when writing posts and comments on social media people explicitly and more deeply engage with COVID-19 related content. -->
Conversations about COVID-19 on social media are often extreme,
negative, or aggressive <span class="citation">(Fan et al.,
2020)</span>. More deeply engaging with this type of content could
negatively affect active authors. The hypothesis that tonality could
explain the negative effects is especially supported by the observation
that spending more time on Twitter than usual increased negative affect.
Communication on Twitter is often found to be more negative and impolite
compared to other SNSs <span class="citation">(Halpern &amp; Gibbs,
2013)</span>. Consuming more negative and misleading information could
hence explain the (slightly) increased levels of negative affect.</p>
<p>Third, the results show that it makes sense to analyze different
communication types and communication channels. Reading reduced positive
affect, while liking, sharing and commenting increased negative affect.
Whereas it was often stated that passive use is bad and active use good
<span class="citation">(Verduyn et al., 2015)</span>, this pattern thus
did not emerge here. Instead, all three types were negative. The results
hence support the findings from <span class="citation">Valkenburg et al.
(2022)</span>, who also could not confirm the claim that active use is
good and that passive use is bad. Focusing on communication channels,
Twitter seems to be more negative, as has often been observed <span
class="citation">(Halpern &amp; Gibbs, 2013)</span>. But, again, all of
these effects are very small. Future research might elaborate on these
specific relations to probe their stability and relevance.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results are hence aligned with the underlying
theoretical models and prior empirical results. The findings support the
Different Susceptibility to Media Effects Theory, which states that
effects are generally small and depend on the type of communication. The
results are well-aligned with mood management theory <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span> or the uses and gratifications
approach <span class="citation">(Katz et al., 1973)</span>, whose
premises preclude particularly negative effects of routine and
widespread media consumption. If the effects of social media were indeed
profoundly negative on average, then people likely would not spend so
much time on social media engaging with COVID-19 content. Likewise,
recent empirical studies and meta-analyses reported rather small
negative effects, too. Several studies found that the effects of various
types of social media use on well-being are small, often too small to
matter <span class="citation">(Bendau et al., 2021; Ferguson et al.,
2021; Meier &amp; Reinecke, 2020; Orben, 2020)</span>, echoing the
results obtained here.</p>
<p>In light of the overall very small effects, engaging in COVID
19-related social media use should not be a major concern for one’s
well-being. That said, the results still imply that it does make sense
to critically reflect upon COVID-19 related social media use. On
average, it is likely more beneficial to post less actively about
COVID-19 on social media and to spend less time on Twitter consuming
COVID-19 related content. The results allow us to reject a positive
effect: Writing more posts on social media will likely not increase
well-being.</p>
<!-- First, in terms of media channels, using Twitter more than usual was related to slightly decreased levels of life satisfaction. -->
<!-- Twitter is considered to have more negative affordances and tonality as compared to other networks such as Instagram [@waterlooNormsOnlineExpressions2018], which might help explain the results. -->
<!-- Second, of all the three COVID-19 related social media activities, people who read about the pandemic more than others showed slightly decreased levels of positive affect, and people who actively posted about the pandemic more than others showed slightly increased levels of negative affect. -->
<!-- On the other hand, however, people who posted more about COVID-19 also showed slightly higher levels of positive affects, so taken together the results are ambivalent. -->
<!-- Finally, another interesting observation is that life satisfaction was remarkably stable. -->
<!-- Hence, even in times of a pandemic, it seems that such broad assessment of life vary only mildly. -->
<!-- This supports the hypothesis that life satisfaction seems to be determined largely by stable factors such as one's genes [@brownEasyHappinessPie2019]. -->
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<!-- The current study analyzed whether changes in media use were related to changes in well-being. -->
<p>Focusing on within-person effects and controlling for several
potential confounders, this study provides an improved perspective on
assessing causality. However, three major challenges remain. First, it
could be that the timing of the interval was wrong; it could be that
effects unfold in shorter or longer intervals. Next, it could be that
there was not sufficient variance in media use and well-being. Without
sufficient variability, statistical models cannot detect existing
effects. Third, it is necessary to control for <em>all</em> relevant
confounding third variables. Although this study included are large list
of confounders, it could still be that crucial variables were missed
<span class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>.
<!-- While controlling for potential confounders can support claims of causality, the procedure implemented here cannot prove causality. -->
<!-- Causality necessitates temporal order, and the cause needs to precede the effect. -->
<!-- The challenge is that regarding media use, such effects often happen immediately or shortly after use, necessitating intervals in the hours, minutes, or even seconds. -->
<!-- In many cases only experience sampling studies asking users at the very moment can produce such knowledge. -->
<!-- However, even then we don't know for certain if we actually measured the right interval. -->
<!-- Effects depend on the intensity of use or the length of the interval. -->
To borrow the words from <span class="citation">Rohrer &amp; Murayama
(2021)</span>, there is no such thing as “the” effect of social media
use on well-being. The results reported here are hence contingent on the
design I used. To document how effects unfold, future research needs to
employ different study designs probing different intervals. More thought
needs to be invested in what factors to control for, and I hope this
study provides a first step into this direction.</p>
<p>Although I had already reduced the predefined SESOIs to be less
conservative, one could argue they were still too large. Media use is
only one aspect of several factors that simultaneously affect
well-being. Is it realistic to expect that changing only <em>one</em> of
these aspects should already manifest in a detectable change in
well-being? Or would it make more sense to expect that thoroughly
committing to say <em>two</em> activities (e.g. regularly exercising
<em>and</em> establishing a reading habit) should then cause a
detectable improvement in well-being? Practically, this would imply a
SESOI half the size defined here, namely <em>b</em> = |.15| for life
satisfaction and <em>b</em> = |.075| for affect. In the case of this
study, however, even halving the SESOI would not make a difference. All
but one effect would still be completely in the null region, and no
effect would fall completely outside of the null region. I encourage
future research to elaborate on what effect sizes are considered
meaningful and what not.
<!-- Again, with this study I hope to provide some first input and guidelines. --></p>
<p>Both media use and well-being were measured using self-reports.
Because assessing well-being necessarily requires introspection, using
self-reports for affect and life satisfaction is adequate. However, for
social media use objective measures are clearly preferable, as people
often cannot reliably estimate their use <span
class="citation">(Scharkow, 2016)</span>. At the same time, most
objective measures cannot capture the content or the motivation of use.
Hence, for the type of research question analyzed here, it still seems
necessary to use self-reported measures. In many cases they can still be
informative <span class="citation">(Verbeij et al., 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Being collected in a single country, the generalizability of the
results is limited. The results apply primarily to the more Western
sphere. They might not hold true in other cultures, especially cultures
with a different media landscape or alternative social media channels.
<!-- That said, being a comparatively large study largely representative of one country, with several waves collected across a large time span, the results should be at least as generalizable as other typical empirical studies collected in the social sciences. -->
<!-- Social media use was measured with an ordinal variable, however in the analyses it was treated as a numerical one. -->
<!-- If treated as an ordinal one, it would have been necessary to analyze four different contrasts for each media measure, which plus the differentiation between between and within factor would have produced eight different measures, we would have made the model exceedingly complex. --></p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this study, COVID-19 related social media use did not meaningfully
affect well-being. Very small negative effects were found for writing
COVID-19 related posts, sharing COVID-19 related content, and spending
more time than usual on Twitter. Factors other than social media use,
however, were meaningfully related to well-being, including physical
health, exercise, satisfaction with democracy, or believing that one is
in control of one’s life. Hence, when trying to improve well-being
during a pandemic, instead of focusing on social media it seems more
fruitful to address other, more pertinent societal problems related to
health care, regular exercise, or a functioning democratic system.</p>
